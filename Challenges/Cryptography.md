## Cryptograph

### What is Cryptograph

The art of protecting information by transforming the plain text into an unreadable format

OR

cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages

### Lets know the meaning of different words

**Encryption** - It is a process used to convert simple readable data known as plain text to unreadable data known as ciphertext which can only be converted to plain text if the user knows the encryption key

**Decryption** - Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data into its original, readable format. It involves the use of a key

**Encoding** - It is the process to transform data in such a format that it can be easily used by different types of systems. The algorithm used to encode the data is publicly available and it can be easily decoded in the readable form if the person knows the algorithm.

**Decode** - Decode is the process of converting the encoded message into plain text by using the publiclly available strings


**Hashing** - Hashing is the process of converting the information into a key using a hash function. The original information cannot be retrieved from the hash key by any means.
