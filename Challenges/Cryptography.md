## Cryptograph

### What is Cryptograph

The art of protecting information by transforming the plain text into an unreadable format

OR

cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages

### Lets know the meaning of different words

**Encryption** - It is a process used to convert simple readable data known as plain text to unreadable data known as ciphertext which can only be converted to plain text if the user knows the encryption key

**Decryption** - Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data into its original, readable format. It involves the use of a key

**Encoding** - It is the process to transform data in such a format that it can be easily used by different types of systems. The algorithm used to encode the data is publicly available and it can be easily decoded in the readable form if the person knows the algorithm.

**Decode** - Decode is the process of converting the encoded message into plain text by using the publiclly available strings


**Hashing** - Hashing is the process of converting the information into a key using a hash function. The original information cannot be retrieved from the hash key by any means. 

### Types of cryptography

- **SYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY** - It is the simplest kind of encryption technique that involves only 1 key to encrypt and decrypt
the most popular symmetric key cryptography system is DES(DATA ENCRYPTION system)

- **ASYMMETRIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY** - It is also called public key cryptography, It uses two keys in a pair of key for encryption and Decryption

    1.) Public key- known to everyone

    2.) private key- known only to that particular person

    ****important**** A message that is encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using a private key
    
    and the message encrypted using private key can be decrypted only with a public key

    some popular assymetric key are RSA, DSA, Elliptic cureve etc.

### There are many Cipher Algorithms but some of the main algorithms are
-  bases (There are 2 sites which I use to encode or decode [cryptii](https://cryptii.com/) [decodeefr](https://www.dcode.fr/en)
      - base32 - always in capital letters
      - base64 - alwayes in alphanumeric + / symbols in it
      - base85 - wierd or unreadable...
***Important tip - if the equal to (=) sign will be there in the end of the text the text then it will be base cipher algorithm***

 - number system
       - base2
       - base8
       - base10
       - base16
