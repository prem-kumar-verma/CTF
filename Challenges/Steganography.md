# A method to hiding something in something 
- **General**
    - Usually when organizer gave us image, music, video, zip, exe, file system, pdf and other files, it a steganography or forensics challenge. Run ```file``` command list
    - Metadata is important. Checkout the exif data of the file by using ```exiftool [filename]``` command
    - Try using ```binwalk [filename]``` on the file. They may hide another file in the file.
        - To extract use ```binwalk -e```
        - To extract one specific signature type, use ```binwalk -D 'png image:png' [filename]```
        - To extract all files, run ```binwalk --dd='.*' [filename]```
    - Try file carve using ```foremost -v [filename] command. Foremost support all files

- **Images**
    - View the image first
    - Use ```strings``` command to that file
        - Try ```grep -i [any string you want to filter] from the ```strings``` command output
        - Example ```grep -i "flag{"``` to filtering the lag format only. ```-i``` option to unable case sensitive.
    - Google the images, diffentiable the ```md5hash```. If you found some image but have a different md5 hash, it may probably have been altered.
    - Analyse the header and the content of the file using any ***hex editor***
    - Know the ***file signature*** Maybe they gave us corrupt header! so fix it!
    - Maybe ***zoom-in*** and ***zoom-out*** method can get the flag
    - Use [https://www.tineye.com/](https://www.tineye.com) to reverse search the image in the internet
    - Use ```imagemagick``` command to do image manipulation
    - Use ***stegsolve.jar*** tools. There are so many CTF I've participated that I used this tool to unhide flag from an image
    - File carve using ```steghide --extract -sf <filename>``` Try find the password with your own-self. Maybe the organizer will give hints or the password may in another file.
    - Check for any corruption on PNG file by using ```pngcheck <filename.png>``` command
    - Detect stegano-hidden data in PNG &BMPs by ```issuing zteg -a <filename.png>
    - Use ***SmartDeblur*** software to fix blurry on image
    - Use ```stegcracker <filename> <wordlist> tools steganography brute-force password utility to uncover hidden data inside files
    - Use ```tesseract``` to scan text in image and cover it to .txt file.
    - Another powerfool tool is called zteg
    - Steganosuite
        - Extract data from image (-x)
    - some of online stegano decoder are
